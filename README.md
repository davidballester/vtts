# VTTs

The goal of this repo is to practice some architecture skills. It is not intended to be developed into a fully functional form, but rather document how I would plan and develop a project such as this one.

VTT stands for Virtual Table Top. The idea for this one is to design a platform with the same concept as [Roll20](https://roll20.net/), where users can run games and a common space is shared by multiple players to run a play session.
