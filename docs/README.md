# Documentation

To document the architecture of the project, I've used the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/). You can open the copy the contents of [the architecture document](./architecture.structurizr) over to the [Structurizr DSL demo](https://structurizr.com/dsl), hit the _render_ button and see it in detail.
